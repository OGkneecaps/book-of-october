Seppadkarvakkarvak Septeepadplek

The following day was not quite a lesson, as much as it was a puzzle. The transcription can be found, written by Thalian, at this link: https://hive.lymphocyte.xyz/en/hidden/sol/2020-11-20-Seppadkarvakkarvak-Septeepadplek

It totals in at aproximiatly twelve thousand words, and could not be distilled into a lesson format. If you wish to catch up, you have been warned. But it is probably good for you to have an understanding of the material, at least at a surface level.

The puzzle is a paragraph written in another language, it has 7 meanings nested 7 times. The first translation was to a scene in Hamlet:

**Hamlet**
_I have of late—but wherefore I know not—lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust?_

Further work is still being done on the puzzle.
